Password Complexity Checker 🔐
Project Overview 🎉
Welcome to the Password Complexity Checker project! This Python script is designed to ensure that user-generated passwords meet specific complexity requirements, enhancing security and making it more difficult for potential attackers to crack them. This project was developed as part of my internship at Prodigy InfoTech.

Features ✅
Checks for at least one uppercase letter 🅰️
Checks for at least one lowercase letter 🔡
Checks for at least one number 🔢
Checks for at least one special character 💥
Ensures a minimum length of 8 characters 📏
Getting Started 🚀
These instructions will help you set up and run the Password Complexity Checker on your local machine.

Prerequisites
Ensure you have Python installed on your system. You can download Python from python.org.

Installation
Clone the repository:


Copy code
git clone https://github.com/Liyu-Desta/PRODIGY_CS_03.git
Navigate to the project directory:


Open the folder that has the cloned git in Visual Studio(VS) code
Usage: In the terminal make sure that you are in the folder which contains PasswordComplexityChecker.py file then,
Run the "python PasswordComplexityChecker.py" script to check the complexity of a password:



The script will prompt you to enter a password and will provide feedback based on the following criteria:

At least one uppercase letter
At least one lowercase letter
At least one number
At least one special character
A minimum length of 8 characters
Example


Create a password please: HelloWorld123!
Your password is strong
Code Explanation
The script uses the re module in Python to perform regular expression searches and ensure that the password meets all the required complexity criteria. 

Lessons Learned 📚
From this project, I've gained valuable insights into using the re package in Python for regular expressions. I've also learned about the importance of ensuring password security by using a variety of character types to make passwords more robust against attacks.
